# SI-GuidedProject-603475-1697622454

The Above project is accomplished using a DL model on Art Detection and Flask Backend server and a react Front end Server


In order to run the project You will have to first run the flask app.py

After that in the terminal (if you are using VScode on Windows) cd into web application (ie change directory into web application) and run

npm start

This should start the Web app on your browser and it should be successfully connected to the backend.

Also the uploading of  the project has deleted all or older commits and this will be fixed shortly.
